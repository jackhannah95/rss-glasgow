## Background

- The Information Services Division (ISD) of the National Health Service (NHS) Scotland produces around 200 official and national statistics publications each year.
- Traditional publication output is a **static pdf document** with accompanying **excel tables**.

```{r out.width = "50%", fig.align = 'center'}
include_graphics(here::here("images", "pdf_report.png"))
```


## Why change?

<p class="comment">
"Users of statistics and data should be at the centre of statistical production; their needs should be understood, their views sought and acted upon, and their use of statistics supported."
</p>

<p style="text-align: right"> <a href="https://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Code-of-Practice-for-Statistics.pdf">- UKSA Code of Practice for Statistics, 2018</a></p>


## The Transforming Publishing Programme

- The Transforming Publishing Programme (TPP) was devised to modernise the way in which ISD produces and presents its statistics

- It's been through many iterations, but mostly operates by "borrowing" staff with particular skills (e.g. R, visualisation, user research, etc.) from other teams within ISD

- Uses "Agile" methodology for project management


## TPP's "vision"

```{r out.width = "60%", fig.align = 'center'}
include_graphics(here::here("images", "vision_poster.png"))
```
