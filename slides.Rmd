## Background

- The [Information Services Division (ISD)](https://www.isdscotland.org/) of the National Health Service (NHS) Scotland produces around 200 official and national statistics publications each year.
- Traditional publication output is a **static pdf document** with accompanying **excel tables**.

```{r out.width = "50%", fig.align = 'center'}
include_graphics(here::here("images", "pdf_report.png"))
```


## Why Change?

<p class="comment">
"Users of statistics and data should be at the centre of statistical production; their needs should be understood, their views sought and acted upon, and their use of statistics supported."
</p>

## The Transforming Publishing Programme

- The [Transforming Publishing Programme (TPP)](https://www.isdscotland.org/Products-and-Services/Transforming-Publishing-Programme/) was devised to modernise the way in which ISD produces and presents its statistics

- It's been through many iterations, but mostly operates by "borrowing" staff with particular skills (e.g. R, visualisation, user research, etc.) from other teams within ISD

- Uses ["Agile" methodology](https://www.isdscotland.org/Products-and-Services/Transforming-Publishing-Programme/Agile-Project-Management/) for project management


## TPP's "vision"

```{r out.width = "60%", fig.align = 'center'}
include_graphics(here::here("images", "vision_poster.png"))
```


## TPP's Approach

- Replacing PDF reports with web applications built using Shiny and D3

- Using git and [GitHub](https://github.com/NHS-NSS-transforming-publications) for version control and peer review

- A full user research process

- Where possible, releasing data files as [open data](https://www.opendata.nhs.scot/)


## What is Shiny?

- [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) is an R package that allows interactive web applications to be built within R

- No experience in web development is necessary

- Shiny apps need to be hosted somewhere - ISD shares a [shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/) account with the Scottish Government and National Records of Scotland

```{r out.width = "25%", fig.align = 'center'}
include_graphics(here::here("images", "shiny.png"))
```


## The User Research Process

```{r out.width = "90%", fig.align = 'center'}
include_graphics(here::here("images", "user_research_process.png"))
```


## Mental Health Inpatient Activity

- The [Mental Health Inpatient Activity](https://www.isdscotland.org/Health-Topics/Mental-Health/Publications/2019-09-10/mental-health-inpatient-activity/) publication was the second official statistics publication in ISD to be released using Shiny

- It was first released in [September 2018](https://www.isdscotland.org/Health%2DTopics/Mental%2DHealth/Publications/2018%2D09%2D25/psychiatric%2Dinpatient%2Dactivity/)

- The entire development process, from initial user engagement to the first release, took around six months


## User Feedback

```{r out.width = "75%", fig.align = 'center'}
include_graphics(here::here("images", "quotes.png"))
```


## Other Shiny Apps in ISD

Not an exhaustive list:

- [Acute Hospital Activity](https://www.isdscotland.org/Health-Topics/Hospital-Care/Publications/2019-05-28/acute-hospital-publication/?41624087096)

- [Drug-Related Hospital Statistics](https://www.isdscotland.org/Health-Topics/Drugs-and-Alcohol-Misuse/Publications/2019-05-28/visualisation.asp)

- [Alcohol Brief Interventions](https://www.isdscotland.org/Health-Topics/Drugs-and-Alcohol-Misuse/Publications/2019-06-25/visualisation.asp)

- [Insights into Social Care in Scotland](https://scotland.shinyapps.io/nhs-social-care/)


## The Limitations of Using Shiny in ISD

- Shiny apps can be difficult to make accessible - particularly when embedded in iFrames

- Confidential data cannot be stored on the shinyapps.io server

- No structured training programme exists


## The Future of Shiny in ISD

```{r out.width = "75%", fig.align = 'center'}
